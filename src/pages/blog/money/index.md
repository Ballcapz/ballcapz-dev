## Roth IRA

- What is a Roth IRA (Individual Retirement Account)?
  - Money is added after tax is taken out
  - Deposits are not tax deductible
  - Withdrawals are tax-free, once certain conditions are met
  - Can only contribute if you make less than \$140,000 per year for a single person(rate is likely to change in the future)
  - Withdrawals are tax-free and penalty free after you are 59 1/2 years old, and it has been 5+ years since your first funding contribution to your Roth IRA.
    - You can withdraw contributions without penalty or tax, but any gains will be taxed and possibly penalized if you don't meet the previous rules.
  - REMEMBER:
    - Name beneficiaries
    - Don't withdraw too early
    - You can't contribute if you make too much money
